    its structure for connection and data upload.

    Attributes:
        project_id (str): Google Cloud project ID associated with the GCS bucket.
        bucket_name (str): Name of the GCS bucket where data will be uploaded.
        folder_path (str): Folder path within the GCS bucket where data will be stored.
        credentials_path (str): Path to the service account credentials JSON file.
        client (storage.Client): Instance of the GCS client for connecting and uploading.

    Methods:
        connect():
            Initializes the GCS client for connecting to the specified bucket.
        upload(data: Any, destination: str):
            Uploads data to the designated path within the GCS bucket.
